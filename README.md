## From Bugs to Layout:My three-week journey Building a Real Estate Website  
This is a simple yet functional real estate platform designed for listing and selling properties and was created as an educational project.
I plan to expand it in the future by adding more features.

To build this project, I was inspired by YouTube tutorials and reviewing several websites. After about **three weeks** of coding and problem-solving, I am proud to have completed my first major project with all its challenges.

I hope this project is a good start to my web development journey.

Best wishes!ðŸ˜Š
